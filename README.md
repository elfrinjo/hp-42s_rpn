# HP-42S RPN Programs

These are my RPN programs to be used with the HP-42S scientific calculator.
As I do not own the original calculator, the programs also run on
[Free42](http://thomasokken.com/free42/) and the
[Swissmicros DM42](https://www.swissmicros.com/dm42.php).

Notes on the usage might be found in each directory.

The directories also contain .raw files which are the binaries.
This is not the git-way but rather useful and I'll give my best to keep them in
sync.

Compilation is done with [Swissmicros' Online Converter](https://www.swissmicros.com/dm42/decoder/)

## License
Most of the programs (the ones I made) are licensed under **GNU GPLv3**.  
Some programs were contributed by others and are stored here for convenience.
If so, this is mentioned in a local readme and the program is subject to
whatever the original author prefers.
